Building Commons
===========

This is repo lists of json-LD structures coming from Building Commons projects (dev-Common,artist-common...) .
It's a list of json-ld structures working on dev-commons projects and are allready final and functional 
Dev-Commons applications share some specifities that make them interoperable: 
- Open Apis
- Common Vocabulary using Web Semantics like schema.org, Activity Streams or any other existing Ontologies/vocabulary
- LinkData (json-LD)

These can be used as starting points, 
but also mean there is a completly open source and functional project behind  (with it's api)


for the moment we used schema.org but freel free to propose equivalent json-ld translated into othervocabularies like Activity Streams or somthing else 

the subject is still being discussed here https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg
and it seems we'll be moving to activity streams soon or simply generate both formats
